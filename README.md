# MohrsCircleCalculator
Draws the Mohr's Circle given a 2D State of Stress

Given the three rectangular components of stress at a point, the two normal components and one shear stress component, this application calculates the Principal Stresses and the Maximum Shear Stress at that point. Also, draws the Mohr's Circle. This application also allows the user to modify the angle of a rectangular element, and outputs the values of the rectangular stress components corresponding to that angle. 

To invoke this application, open the file mohrsCircle2d.html in the browser. Tested this on Chrome.
